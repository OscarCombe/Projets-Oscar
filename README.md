Here are some projects and papers I have completed as part of my studies or outside of school in various languages across different disciplines related to the field of economics and finance.

--------------------------------------------------------------

- Financial Project with Python : Complete creation and study from scratch of 3 differents financials style index. Also an interactive interface usable with Streamlit. This project got the best grade of my Applied Python for Finance Class during my first semester of Master degree (19/20). 

- Econometrics Research : In this replication file, we reproduce the findings of an article studying the reduction of racial bias through digital technologies in NYPD reporting, using R. We also apply alternative econometric methods to compare and contrast our results with those of the original study. I realized this project while I was working with the researcher Grazia Cecere at Les Mines Telecom. 

- Portfolio Management Project : In this portfolio management project, we replicate the process of constructing model portfolios across various market indices (S&P 500, Stoxx 600, MSCI World) using VBA.

- Query translator : In this VBA-SQL project, we develop a "query translator" tool in Excel for financial data, allowing users with no VBA or SQL experience to generate SQL queries through an interactive menu.

- Statistics : In this statistical analysis project, we use R to analyze data on non-financial enterprises. Through R Markdown, we present findings with code, visualizations, and interpretations, applying various statistical methods to explore trends and patterns within the data.

- Econometrics Paper : I realised this research paper for a Finanical Econometrics class in Boston College, to better understand the roots of corruption. It requires a multidimensional approach that bridges both institutional and economic domains. Methodologically, the study employs a panel data econometric approach, utilizing fixed effects models to control for unobserved, time-invariant heterogeneity across countries.


- Economic Paper : Co-author of an economic note for a Banque de France competition. The topic was global fragmentation, and we focused our paper on the European technology scene in this fragmentation process.
